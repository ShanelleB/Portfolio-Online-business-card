          <h2> About </h2>
          <p> After working as a cosmotologist I found myself wanting to do more with computers. I would constantly think of games and apps that could be helpful or fun for everyone. I have always loved technology and tinkering which led me to this field. These are some of the reasons why I want to become a developer:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Playing video games (5yrs+) one of my hobbies</li>
            <li> Building computers(8yrs+)/websits/apps/etc </li>
            <li> Watching my guardian develop websites</li>
            <li> Wanting to develop my own video game</li>
          </ol>
          <p> There are unlimited possibilities in this field and I am excited to explore all of them. If you're looking for help on a project or a fellow developer who is wants to start a new project, please feel free to reach out at any time. I look forward to working with you!</p>
